## 🔧 Installation & Setup
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arorakrishh/sign-language-detector.git
cd sign-language-detector
```

---



## 💡 Usage
1.  **Data Collection**: Utilize `data-collection.ipynb` to gather and prepare your ASL dataset.
2.  **Model Training**: Leverage the YOLOv5 framework with the provided configurations (`data.yaml`, `hyp.yaml`, `opt.yaml`) to train a custom sign language detection model.
3.  **Real-time Detection**: Deploy the trained model to process video streams and convert sign language gestures into readable text in real-time.

**Real-World Use Cases:**

*   **Accessibility Tools**: Develop assistive technologies for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, enabling communication through sign language recognition.
*   **Educational Resources**: Create interactive learning platforms for teaching and practicing sign language.
*   **Communication Aids**: Integrate sign language detection into communication devices to facilitate interaction between sign language users and others.

To use the project, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (OpenCV, PyTorch, NumPy).
2.  Run the `data-collection.ipynb` notebook to collect or prepare your dataset.
3.  Train the YOLOv5 model using your dataset and the provided configuration files.
4.  Deploy the trained model in a Python script or Jupyter Notebook for real-time sign language detection.
