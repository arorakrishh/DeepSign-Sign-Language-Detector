# 🖐️ Real-Time Sign Language Detection

A real-time sign language recognition system built using **YOLOv5**, designed to detect and classify hand gestures into meaningful text. This project aims to bridge communication gaps by recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures from video streams with high accuracy.
